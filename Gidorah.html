                MonsterVerse Ghidorah
                In 2014, Legendary Pictures announced their acquisition of the licenses to Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah from Toho to use in their MonsterVerse franchise.[53] The trio were introduced in Kong: Skull Island in a post-credits scene depicting cave paintings of all three monsters, including Godzilla.[54]
                
                In June 2017, a press release confirmed Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah would all be featured in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.[55] In April 2018, Jason Liles, Alan Maxson, and Richard Dorton were cast to provide the motion capture performances of the heads of King Ghidorah, with Liles performing the middle head, Maxson performing the right head, and Dorton performing the left head. Other actors would perform the rest of King Ghidorah's body.[10][11]
                
                This version of Ghidorah standing at 521 ft (158.8 m) tall, weighing 141,056 tons[failed verification] with an unknown wingspan that allows it to fly at a maximum speed of 550[failed verification] knots.[56] Unlike previous incarnations of the character, here Ghidorah's three heads are portrayed with independent personalities from each other, although Ghidorah overall still exhibits the inherent sadism of most incarnations: the middle head is the leader and more prominently sadistic than the other two, the right head is angry and thirsty for battle, and the left head is curious, distractable and more submissive - the heads are officially named Ichi, Ni and San respectively[57] (meaning "One", "Two" and "Three" in Japanese). It is referred to as "Monster Zero" (a reference to Invasion of Astro-Monster) by the organization Monarch. According to Monarch's database, ancient civilizations called the monster "Ghidorah".[56]
                
                In this incarnation, King Ghidorah is portrayed as a rival apex predator to Godzilla that originated from another world, "[falling] from the stars" in ancient times, who actively seeks to usurp Godzilla's domination of the other monsters; and unlike Godzilla, he is actively murderous and genocidal towards humans while threatening to destroy Earth's ecosphere. It's briefly speculated by the characters that Ghidorah's motives behind the destruction are terraforming the Earth into a more ideal environment for himself, though the novelization briefly suggests when discussing said theory that maybe Ghidorah has no higher end-goal than hatefully murdering every living thing that isn't him.[58]

                Main article: Godzilla king of the Monsters(franchise)
                King Ghidorah appeared in a brief piece of stock footage in Terror of Mechagodzilla.[70] The mechanical head of Mecha-King Ghidorah appears briefly in the opening of Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II.[71] Stock footage of King Ghidorah was used in four episodes of Courage the Cowardly Dog: Courage in the Big Stinkin' City,[72] The Tower of Dr. Zalost, Fishy Business[73] and Nowhere TV.[74] Spin-off characters based on King Ghidorah (although quadrupedal in appearance) were featured in other Toho films: Desghidorah in Rebirth of Mothra [75] and Keizer Ghidorah in Godzilla: Final Wars.[23] A post-credits scene in Kong: Skull Island depicts cave paintings of Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah.[54] It was implied that King Ghidorah took over Mechagodzilla's consciousness in Godzilla vs. Kong.[76]
